## Aviator Game Guide

The goal of Aviator is to cash out your bet before the plane crashes.
You can do this by clicking on the "Cash Out" button at any time.
The longer you wait to cash out, the higher your potential payout.
However, if the plane crashes before you cash out, you lose your bet.

There are two main strategies that you can use when playing Aviator:

-   **The conservative strategy:** This strategy involves cashing out
    your bet early, even if the potential payout is not very high. This
    strategy is less risky, but it also has a lower potential reward.
-   **The aggressive strategy:** This strategy involves waiting to cash
    out your bet until the potential payout is very high. This strategy
    is more risky, but it also has a higher potential reward.

The best strategy for you will depend on your individual risk tolerance.
